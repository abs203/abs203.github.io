      <h3 class="post-title">How to join anonymous?</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>
          First, we are going to share few things with
          our readers who are interested to join the
          <em><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_(group)">Anonymous group</a></strong></em>. Anonymous is not an
          organization which is controlled by one
          person. It is the group of interconnected
          people worldwide and the main identity of
          anonymous members is the guyfox mask.
          We can only identify other members of
          anonymous by this mask. There is no other
          identity like id card and other things.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Even we also won’t be able to recognize other</em>
          anonymous members <strong>without the mask.</strong>
          Maybe now you know what actually anonymous
          group is. If we know other members of
          anonymous its means <em>there is no meaning of
          anonymity.</em> The anonymous concept was
          started <strong>for hiding your identity from other
          people.</strong>
         You <strong>won’t be able to join the anonymous
          group</strong> because <em>there is no headquarters </em>of
          anonymous which controlled <strong>every operation
          of anonymous.</strong><br>
